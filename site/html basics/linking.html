			<p>These words have very little semantic overlap; a snallygaster is “a mythical nocturnal creature that is reported chiefly from rural Maryland, is reputed to be part reptile and part bird, and is said to prey on poultry and children,” and a snollygoster is “a shrewd, unprincipled person.” Despite the fact that the definitions are considerably different the words are occasionally mixed up, largely on account of fact that they look similar to each other, and dissimilar to pretty much every other word in English.</p>
			<p>Many people feel that the words are connected; it has been suggested that snollygoster comes from snallygaster (which is thought to be from modification of Pennsylvania German schnelle geeschter, literally, quick spirits). One of the problems with this theory is that our evidence for snollygoster comes well before that for snallygaster; the former dates to the 1840s, while our earliest use of the latter comes in 1900 (in what appears to be a misspelling of snollygoster).</p>
